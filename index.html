            </header>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in
                the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling;
                with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding
                of what is possible.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by
                Brendan Eich.
                JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
                animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
            </p>
            <code>
                const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
                myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";
            </code>
            <p>JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on
                top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These
                include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality
                    such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream
                    from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.</li>
                <li>Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content
                    providers, such as Disqus or Facebook.</li>
                <li>Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building
                    sites and applications.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="JS_Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>JS Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use
                as part of a sentence.
            </p>
            <p>To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable.
                To do this, we type the keyword let followed by the name you want to call your variable:
            </p>
            <code>
                let myName;
                let myAge;
            </code>
            <p>You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should
                stick to just using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an
                    international audience.</li>
                <li>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs
                    to mean specific things, so may get confusing.</li>
                <li>
                    Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A safe convention to stick to is lower camel case, where you stick together multiple words, using
                    lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been using this for
                    our variable names in the article so far.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single
                    letters/numbers, or big long phrases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Variables are case sensitive — so myage is a different variable from myAge.
                </li>
                <li>
                    One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by
                    this, we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like
                    var, function, let, and for as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and
                    so you'll get errors.

                <h2>Useful string methods</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Now that we've looked at the very basics of strings, let's move up a gear and start thinking about what
                useful operations we can do on strings with built-in methods, such as finding the length of a text
                string, joining and splitting strings, substituting one character in a string for another, and more.
            </p>
            <p>On a related note, you can return any character inside a string by using square bracket notation — this
                means you include square brackets ([]) on the end of your variable name. Inside the square brackets, you
                include the number of the character you want to return, so for example to retrieve the first letter
                you'd do this:
            </p>
            <code>
                browserType[0];
            </code>
            <p>You can extract a substring from a string using the slice() method. You pass it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the index at which to start extracting</li>
                <li>the index at which to stop extracting. This is exclusive, meaning that the character at this index
                    is not included in the extracted substring.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="JS_Arrays" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>JS Arrays</h2>
            </header>
            <p>In the final article of this module, we'll look at arrays — a neat way of storing a list of data items
                under a single variable name. Here we look at why this is useful, then explore how to create an array,
                retrieve, add, and remove items stored in an array, and more besides.
            </p>
            <p>Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain
                multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the
                same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list
                individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the
                same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series of product items and their prices stored in an
                array, and we want to loop through them all and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the
                prices together and printing out the total price at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>If we didn't have arrays, we'd have to store every item in a separate variable, then call the code that
                does the printing and adding separately for each item. This would be much longer to write out, less
                efficient, and more error-prone. If we had 10 items to add to the invoice it would already be annoying,
                but what about 100 items, or 1000? We'll return to this example later on in the article.</p>
            <p>Suppose we want to store a shopping list in an array. Paste the following code into the console:</p>
            <code>
                const shopping = ["bread", "milk", "cheese", "hummus", "noodles"];
                console.log(shopping);
            </code>
            <p>To add one or more items to the end of an array we can use push(). Note that you need to include one or
                more items that you want to add to the end of your array.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
                        cities.push("Cardiff");
                        console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Liverpool", "Cardiff" ]
                        cities.push("Bradford", "Brighton");
                        console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Liverpool", "Cardiff", "Bradford", "Brighton" ]</code>
                </li>
                <li>The new length of the array is returned when the method call completes. If you wanted to store the
                    new array length in a variable, you could do something like this:
                    <code>
                        const cities = ["Manchester", "Liverpool"];
                        const newLength = cities.push("Bristol");
                        console.log(cities); // [ "Manchester", "Liverpool", "Bristol" ]
                        console.log(newLength); // 3

                    </code>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Looping_code" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Looping code</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic
                calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to
                complete. Here we'll look at the loop structures available in JavaScript that handle such needs.
            </p>
            <p>Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different
                each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables.
            </p>
            <p>Suppose we wanted to draw 100 random circles on a <canvas> element (press the Update button to run the
                    example again and again to see different random sets):
                    Here's the JavaScript code that implements this example:
            </p>
            <code>
                const btn = document.querySelector("button");
                const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
                const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

                document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
                canvas.width = document.documentElement.clientWidth;
                canvas.height = document.documentElement.clientHeight;
                });

                function random(number) {
                return Math.floor(Math.random() * number);
                }

                function draw() {
                ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
                for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                ctx.beginPath();
                ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)";
                ctx.arc(
                random(canvas.width),
                random(canvas.height),
                random(50),
                0,
                2 * Math.PI,
                );
                ctx.fill();
                }
                }

                btn.addEventListener("click", draw);

            </code>
            <p>In the "drawing circles" example above, you don't have a collection of items to loop through: you really
                just want to run the same code 100 times. In a case like that, you should use the for loop. This has the
                following syntax:</p>
            <code>
                for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
                    // code to run
                  }
                  
            </code>
            <p>Here we have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The keyword for, followed by some parentheses.</li>
                <li>Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semicolons:</li>
                <li>Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop iterates.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <h2>JS Functions</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a
                single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short
                command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore
                fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and
                parameters.
            </p>
            <p>In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through
                the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to
                start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.
            </p>
            <p>Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and
                you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or
                if...else statement, you are making use of a function.
            </p>
            <h4>Built-in browser functions</h4>
            <p>We've used functions built into the browser a lot in this course. Every time we manipulated a text
                string, for example:</p>
            <code>
                const myText = "I am a string";
                const newString = myText.replace("string", "sausage");
                console.log(newString);
                // the replace() string function takes a source string,
                // and a target string and replaces the source string,
                // with the target string, and returns the newly formed string
            </code>
            <p>Or every time we manipulated an array:</p>
            <code>
                const myArray = ["I", "love", "chocolate", "frogs"];
                const madeAString = myArray.join(" ");
                console.log(madeAString);
                // the join() function takes an array, joins
                // all the array items together into a single
                // string, and returns this new string
                
            </code>
            <h4>Anonymous function example</h4>
            <p>For example, let's say you want to run some code when the user types into a text box. To do this you can
                call the addEventListener() function of the text box. This function expects you to pass it (at least)
                two parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the name of the event to listen for, which in this case is keydown</li>
                <li>a function to run when the event happens.</li>
            </ul>

                fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define them, scope, and
                parameters.
            </p>
            <p>In JavaScript, you'll find functions everywhere. In fact, we've been using functions all the way through
                the course so far; we've just not been talking about them very much. Now is the time, however, for us to
                start talking about functions explicitly, and really exploring their syntax.
            </p>
            <p>Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and
                you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or
                if...else statement, you are making use of a function.
            </p>
            <h4>Built-in browser functions</h4>
            <p>We've used functions built into the browser a lot in this course. Every time we manipulated a text
                string, for example:</p>
            <code>
                const myText = "I am a string";
                const newString = myText.replace("string", "sausage");
                console.log(newString);
                // the replace() string function takes a source string,
                // and a target string and replaces the source string,
                // with the target string, and returns the newly formed string
            </code>
            <p>Or every time we manipulated an array:</p>
            <code>
                const myArray = ["I", "love", "chocolate", "frogs"];
                const madeAString = myArray.join(" ");
                console.log(madeAString);
                // the join() function takes an array, joins
                // all the array items together into a single
                // string, and returns this new string
                
            </code>
            <h4>Anonymous function example</h4>
            <p>For example, let's say you want to run some code when the user types into a text box. To do this you can
                call the addEventListener() function of the text box. This function expects you to pass it (at least)
                two parameters:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the name of the event to listen for, which in this case is keydown</li>
                <li>a function to run when the event happens.</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>JS Classes</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
                Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to
                classes.
            </p>
            <h3>Defining classes</h3>
            <p>Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function
                declarations, a class can be defined in two ways: a class expression or a class declaration.
            </p>
            <code>
                // Declaration
                class Rectangle {
                  constructor(height, width) {
                    this.height = height;
                    this.width = width;
                  }
                }
                
                // Expression; the class is anonymous but assigned to a variable
                const Rectangle = class {
                  constructor(height, width) {
                    this.height = height;
                    this.width = width;
                  }
                };
                
                // Expression; the class has its own name
                const Rectangle = class Rectangle2 {
                  constructor(height, width) {
                    this.height = height;
                    this.width = width;
                  }
                };
                 
            </code>
            <p>Like function expressions, class expressions may be anonymous, or have a name that's different from the
                variable that it's assigned to. However, unlike function declarations, class declarations have the same
                temporal dead zone restrictions as let or const and behave as if they are not hoisted.

            <h4>Built-in browser functions</h4>
            <p>We've used functions built into the browser a lot in this course. Every time we manipulated a text
                string, for example:</p>
            <p>The body of a class is the part that is in curly braces {}. This is where you define class members, such
                as methods or constructor.
                The body of a class is executed in strict mode even without the "use strict" directive.
                A class element can be characterized by three aspects:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Kind: Getter, setter, method, or field

                <li>

                </li>

                    Visibility: Public or private

                <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
            </header>
            <p>A regular expression (regex for short) allow developers to match strings against a pattern, extract
                submatch information, or simply test if the string conforms to that pattern. Regular expressions are
                used in many programming languages, and JavaScript's syntax is inspired by Perl.
            </p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Regular expressions are a important concept in formal language theory. They are a way to describe a
                possibly infinite set of character strings (called a language). A regular expression, at its core, needs
                the following features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A set of characters that can be used in the language, called the alphabet.</li>
                <li>Concatenation: ab means "the character a followed by the character b".</li>
                <li>Union: a|b means "either a or b".</li>
                <li>Kleene star: a* means "zero or more a characters".</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Assuming a finite alphabet (such as the 26 letters of the English alphabet, or the entire Unicode
                character set), all regular languages can be generated by the features above. Of course, many patterns
                are very tedious to express this way (such as "10 digits" or "a character that's not a space"), so
                JavaScript regular expressions include many shorthands, introduced below.
            </p>
            <p>The other ASCII characters, namely space character, ", ', _, and any letter character not mentioned
                above, are not valid escape sequences. In Unicode-unaware mode, escape sequences that are not one of the
                above become identity escapes: they represent the character that follows the backslash. For example, \a
                represents the character a. This behavior limits the ability to introduce new escape sequences without
                causing backward compatibility issues, and is therefore forbidden in Unicode-aware mode.</p>

                <h2>JS error reference</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Below, you'll find a list of errors which are thrown by JavaScript. These errors can be a helpful
                debugging aid, but the reported problem isn't always immediately clear. The pages below will provide
                additional details about these errors. Each error is an object based upon the Error object, and has a
                name and a message.
            </p>
            <p>Errors displayed in the Web console may include a link to the corresponding page below to help you
                quickly comprehend the problem in your code.</p>
            <h3>List of errors</h3>
            <p>In this list, each page is listed by name (the type of error) and message (a more detailed human-readable
                error message). Together, these two properties provide a starting point toward understanding and
                resolving the error. For more information, follow the links below!
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Error: Permission denied to access property "x"</li>
                <li>InternalError: too much recursion</li>
                <li>RangeError: BigInt division by zero</li>
                <li>RangeError: BigInt negative exponent</li>
                <li>RangeError: argument is not a valid code point</li>
                <li>RangeError: invalid array length</li>
                <li>RangeError: invalid date</li>
                <li>RangeError: precision is out of range</li>
                <li>RangeError: radix must be an integer</li>
                <li>RangeError: repeat count must be less than infinity</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>JavaScript technologies overview</h3>
            <p>Whereas HTML defines a webpage's structure and content and CSS sets the formatting and appearance,
                JavaScript adds interactivity to a webpage and creates rich web applications.
                However, the umbrella term "JavaScript" as understood in a web browser context contains several very
                different elements. One of them is the core language (ECMAScript), another is the collection of the Web
                APIs, including the DOM (Document Object Model).
            </p>
            <h3>JavaScript, the core language (ECMAScript)</h3>
            <p>
                The core language of JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee as a language named
                ECMAScript. "ECMAScript" is the term for the language standard, but "ECMAScript" and "JavaScript" can be
                used interchangeably.

                This core language is also used in non-browser environments, for example in Node.js.
            </p>
            <h3>Standardization process</h3>
            <p>ECMAScript editions are approved and published as a standard by the ECMA General Assembly on a yearly
                basis. All development is public on the Ecma TC39 GitHub organization, which hosts proposals, the
                official specification text, and meeting notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before the 6th edition of ECMAScript (known as ES6), specifications were published once every several
                years, and are commonly referred by their major version numbers — ES3, ES5, etc. After ES6, the
                specification is named by the publishing year — ES2017, ES2018, etc. ES6 is synonymous with ES2015.
                ESNext is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version is at the time of writing. ESNext
                features are more correctly called proposals, because, by definition, the specification has not been
                finalized yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current committee-approved snapshot of ECMA-262 is available in PDF and HTML format on Ecma
                International's ECMA-262 language specification page. ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are continuously maintained
                and kept up to date by the specification editors; the TC39 website hosts the latest, up-to-date ECMA-262
                and ECMA-402 versions.
            </p>
            <p>
                New language features, including introduction of new syntaxes and APIs and revision of existing
                behaviors, are discussed in the form of proposals. Each proposal goes through a 4-stage process, and is
                typically implemented by JavaScript engines at stage 3 or stage 4 and thus available for public
                consumption.
